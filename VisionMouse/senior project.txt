to integrate both parts of the programe we will require threads.
threads are diffferent on both OS's that we are using at the moment. two solutions possible, one abandon linux and develop soly on windows and only use windows threads, or two use a third party library such as boost:threads that abstracts to a different layer the threads and thus works for both os's
